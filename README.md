# Data Analysis Assignment

## 📌 Overview
This repository contains my submission for the **Data Analysis Assignment**.  
The goal was to load, analyze, and visualize a dataset using **Python, Pandas, and Matplotlib**.  
I used the classic **Iris dataset** for this analysis.

---

## 🎯 Objectives
- Load and explore a dataset in CSV-like format.
- Perform data cleaning and check for missing values.
- Generate summary statistics of the numerical features.
- Conduct grouping analysis on categorical features.
- Create visualizations to better understand the dataset.

---

## 🧑‍💻 Contents
- **data_analysis_assignment.ipynb** → Jupyter Notebook with:
  - Dataset exploration
  - Cleaning steps
  - Basic statistical analysis
  - Grouped means by species
  - Visualizations (line chart, bar chart, histogram, scatter plot)
  - Observations and explanations for each output

---

## 📊 Visualizations
The notebook includes the following plots:
1. **Line Chart** – Trends in sepal length across samples.  
2. **Bar Chart** – Average petal length per species.  
3. **Histogram** – Distribution of sepal length.  
4. **Scatter Plot** – Sepal length vs. petal length by species.  

---

## ✅ Conclusion
The Iris dataset shows clear distinctions between species, especially in petal measurements.  
These patterns highlight how statistical analysis and visualization can be used to understand datasets effectively.
